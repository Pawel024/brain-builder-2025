    "\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence massively relies on data, and data needs to be stored somewhere. \n",

    "In this chapter, we dive into the practical world of file handling in Python. Efficiently working with files is a crucial skill for any data scientist, engineer, or researcher. We will explore how to read from and write to different types of files, enabling you to manipulate data. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 Text Files\n",
    "One of the most common ways to store data is by storing them in a text file. \n",
    "Unlike binary files, which may contain data in a format only interpretable by specific software, text \n",
    "files hold *human-readable* content.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics of Text Files:**\n",
    "- **Plain Text**: Text files consist of unformatted plain text. They do not include any special \n",
    "formatting, styles, or embedded objects commonly found in word processor documents.\n",
    "- **Encoding**: Text files are often encoded using character encodings like UTF-8 or ASCII. Encoding refers to the method used to represent characters as sequences of bytes. It defines a mapping between the characters in a character set (like ASCII, UTF-8, or UTF-16) and their binary representations. It is not too important to know what they mean for now, just keep in mind that if you open a dataset and it looks it contains many weird-looking characters, it most likely means it uses a different encoding.\n",
    "- **Line-based Structure**: Information in a text file is organized into lines, with each line typically representing a separate piece of information or record. Lines are usually delimited by newline characters (`\\n`)."

In order to train models on these images, they need to be converted and stored into data files. In this section, we will cover how to read these types of files.\n",

    "Before reading images, it is important to realize how images are stored. An image is a visual representation of information, and it is composed of individual picture elements, commonly known as **pixels**. Pixels are the smallest unit of an image, and each pixel holds information about the color of a tiny square in the overall image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Colors in digital images are created by combining different intensities of three primary colors: **Red**, **Green**, and **Blue**. This color model is known as *RGB*. Each pixel in an RGB image has three values representing the intensity of Red, Green, and Blue, respectively. The combination of these three colors in varying intensities produces a wide spectrum of colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, an RGB triplet `(200, 50, 100)` represents a pixel with a moderate intensity of red (`200`), a low intensity of green (`50`), and a moderate intensity of blue (`100`). Combining these three intensities results in a specific color for that pixel. The maximum value a RGB value regularly can take is 256 (1 byte)."

It is a lossy compression format, meaning it reduces file size by discarding some information that the human eye may not easily notice. JPEG is well-suited for photographs and images with complex color gradients. However, due to the lossy compression, repeatedly saving a JPEG image can result in a degradation of image quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PNG** is another widely-used image format, but unlike JPEG, it uses *lossless* compression. This means that no information is lost during compression, resulting in higher image quality. PNG is well-suited for images with sharp edges, transparency, or simple graphics. It supports a full range of colors and has become a standard for web graphics, logos, and images where preserving fine details is crucial."
