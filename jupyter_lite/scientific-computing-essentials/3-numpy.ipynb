    "## *3.2 Understanding NumPy*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2.1 Data Structures: Linked Lists vs Arrays\n",
    "To understand why NumPy can be very powerful we must first understand how lists are stored on your computer. Note that this explanation is  simplified as we are not teaching this to you as Computer Science Engineering students. However, this explanation can help you understand the performance benefits and limitations of NumPy Arrays. If you want to know more about this topic, consider taking a course on Data Structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variables\n",
    "All variables in Python are stored in the **Random Access Memory (RAM)**. This is a very fast storage medium that your computer's processor can easily access, it's meant for temporary data. The RAM stores values in blocks of data. When creating a variable such a block in RAM is reserved for a variable. This block also has a certain **memory address** that the computer's Memory Manager can use to re-access the values. There wouldn't be much point to storing values if we cannot access them later.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a variable would be stored in an certain address and each time you call the variable, the computer goes into the ram, looks for the memory address and return the value. When overwriting the variable (if of the same datatype), the value at that address gets updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Arrays\n",
    "A very useful data structure is a list of variables in a set order. A list of things in a set order occur in many things in life and also in engineering. \n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way of storing a list of data is in the shape of an array. An array consists of multiple blocks (elements) next to each other, this group of elements shares the same memory address. This memory address is the first element. If you want to access elements behind the first element, you feed the array an index and the computer will return the value associated with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an array is declared, a set amount of blocks will need to be reserved. This means that the length of an array cannot be changed, so no elements can be added or removed. The only way to do this is to copy the array entirely and move it to another set of blocks. Another limitation is that the data types of the elements must be the same, as the blocksize (which is determined by the type of variable stored in the element is set upon declaration).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linked Lists\n",
    "**Linked lists** are stored in a different way. Each element in a list actually occupies two blocks, one for the actual **value** and one pointing towards the next memory address of the subsequent element (**pointer**). This set of a value and a pointer is called a **node**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When your computer goes through a linked list it needs to navigate through a lot of different memory addresses. This requires a lot more computational power and is less efficient than just accessing an array. The advantage of a linked list is that it is really efficient and easy to add or remove elements, as you can just change the pointer of the previous element. It is also possible to have different types in lists as every time an element is added, new blocks will be reserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/Array_vs_LinkedList.png\" alt=\"Arrays vs Linked Lists\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The grey boxes represent memory addresses used for other things than storing the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Difference\n",
    "These subtle differences have a very large implication on the characteristics of the two. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Linked Lists**\n",
    "- **Dynamic Size**: Lists in Python can dynamically grow or shrink. You can easily add or remove elements this adds a lot of flexibility.\n",
    "- **Mixed Types**: Lists can store elements of different data types. For example, you can have integers, strings, and other data types in the same list.\n",
    "- **Linked Structure**: It can be computationally expensive to evaluate the linked structure of long lists, as your computer needs to navigate through many blocks in the RAM. Linked lists have a large memory overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Arrays**\n",
    "- **Fixed Size**: NumPy arrays have a fixed size upon creation. You need to create a new array if you want to change the size.\n",
    "- **Homogeneous Data Type**: All elements in a NumPy array must be of the same data type. This enforced homogeneity allows for more efficient storage and operations.\n",
    "- **Contiguous Memory**: Arrays are implemented as contiguous blocks of memory, making them more efficient for certain operations and larger arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially the trade-off between using a linked list and an array is between flexibility and its performance. Linked lists are really flexible but they are really slow to evaluate. Arrays are the opposite. These days computers are really powerful and for most tasks there will be no notice performance difference. However, in aerospace engineering or artificial intelligence where we work with large sets of data, there can be a very large difference in performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2.2 NumPy and Arrays in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The list type in Python resembles something like the linked list. In reality, Python lists use a data type called a dynamic array which offers some benefits of arrays to a linked list, but the general idea is the same. A dynamic array is more flexible whilst a static array is better in terms of performance. For those who are interested, this article details the implementation of dynamic arrays in Python: https://www.laurentluce.com/posts/python-list-implementation/.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy allows you to work with static arrays in Python by introducing the numpy.array datatype. Besides that it also introduces a very large library of operations, tools and functions to work with these arrays. Because of this it is seen as a fundamental library in Python."

    "## *3.3 Using NumPy effectively*\n",
    "Now you have learned about NumPy, you have access to a powerful framework for numerical computing, and using it effectively can you give you a vast performance increase in your programs. However, it quite commonly occurs that people are not using the NumPy arrays to their full advantage and confuse them with the usage of lists. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the example below. In this first case, someone has simply replaced normal python lists with an array. The array is initiated with a single element being 0. After reading this notebook you should know that this is really bad usage of NumPy because arrays have a set amount of elements. For a large number of points, they are being iteratively added to the NumPy array. However, the mistake is made because the array is redefined, and thus copied every single time a number is added. This means that there are 1e5 copies of that array in memory, which is very inefficient usage of the memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case 2, normal Python lists are used in the exact same manner, but now `list_1.append()` is used. The dynamic list is updated and no new copy is saved. This makes case 2 using 'vanilla' Python significantly faster than case 1 using NumPy."

    "This example highlights a few things. First of all, you should really be careful to use NumPy in the correct way and be aware of the differences between lists and arrays. Secondly, it shows us that NumPy arrays are inherently quite bad at iterative methods. This has to do with the fact that NumPy creates an entirely new array every time you use the append function, this reserves a new space in memory, copies the entire old array and adds the new value. The traditional Python method would only have to add a new element to the existing linked list hence being much faster.\n",
